    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we build a simple optimization model representing a stylized national power system. While the representation of the system is extremely simplified, it allows to investigate some basic mechanisms which one would also encounter in a more detailed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system consists of \n",
    "* existing nuclear, coal, gas, wind and solar power plants with a given installed power capacity; only the running (variable) costs of these plants are considered.\n",
    "* Additionally, the optimized solution may include new gas, wind, and solar capacity, whose capacity is optimized and leads to certain fixed costs. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The operation (power output) of all of these plants is optimized for a single year. This year is approximated by four seasons. Therefore, we implicitly assume that within each of the seasons the operation of all plants is constant (only one power production level for nuclear power in spring, summer, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "This power system is loosely based on the German power supply. This system is a suitable example due to the diversity of the power plants and the *relatively* small interconnection capacity to neighboring countries. In contrast, modelling the Swiss power supply is much more difficult. This is due to the heavy reliance on hydro power and the large amount of energy exchange with the neighboring countries: Modelling the Swiss grid generally requires at least modelling the neighboring countries as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simple structure, this model allows to capture some interesting features related to the expansion and profitability of wind and solar power:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The optimal system configuration after a nuclear and coal phase-out strongly depends on the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions price. Both wind/solar and natural gas power plants could make up for the reduced generation capacity. Here we investigate how the optimal mix electricity mix (gas or wind/solar) of a future power system changes for increasing emissions prices.\n",
    "* Then we turn to the case where new solar is forced into the system *exogenously*, i.e. defined by us instead of being optimized by the model.\n",
    "* Finally, in the BONUS exercise we consider the case of additional storage capacity in the model. This storage allows to \"spread out\" the solar production in summer over the whole year. It therefore affects the value of this resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model we aggregate all power plants which are using a certain fuel. For example, we assume that there is 11'000 MW of nuclear power. In a real power system, there would be between 8 and 11 single nuclear power plants, each with their own operating schedule and individual technical properties. The same holds for the coal, gas, wind and solar plants. Treating them all as a single combined power plant is a common approximation. It makes the model much simpler while still allowing us to learn interesting things. However, through these simplifications we miss out on many technical details. *Whether or not these details are relevant depends on the research questions we are asking! It is very important to align the model design with its purpose.*\n",
    "\n",
    "All power plants are characterized by their efficiency, the fuel cost, the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of the fuel, and their existing capacity. In addition, newly built power plants (new gas, wind, and solar) also have an annualized capital cost (i.e. annual share of the discounted capital investment cost). As mentioned in the lecture, this annual cost is calculated from the discount rate, the power plant lifetime, and the total capital cost per unit of installed capacity (i.e. what you need to pay upfront in order to get the power plant built). Wind and solar plants have seasonal capacity factors. They determine how much solar/wind power can be produced during each season.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **_Important:_**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The model is implemented in Python. You won't need to come up with code yourself, but you will write additional constraints based on the examples provided to you (Bonus task). Since these model components must be correct for rest of the assignment, you will be assisted to get this right in any case. Nevertheless, you should give it a try yourself. You don't need to understand in detail why things are implemented in Python the way they are. However, it is very important that you understand what the different parts of the model code are doing. The structure of an optimization model as the one shown here is always the same, independent of the programming language.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">All model input and output data required for the analysis are generated for you, i.e. you don't have to take care of extracting the data from the model. Please copy the tables to the Excel file for analysis.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Tasks are labeled as either **discussion** or **analysis**. Discussion tasks don't require additional data analysis or plots.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The BONUS exercise requires some additional changes to the model, in order to include storage capacity in the system. Similar to the BONUS Task 3.b, this requires the definition of an additional constraint.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **_Very important:_**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**You can reset the model at any time by selecting \"Run->Run all above selected cell\" in the Jupyter notebook.** (For example if you get errors because model components have already been defined.)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The analysis is done in Excel. The most advanced Excel function required to perform the analysis is `SUMIFS`. If you are not familiar with it, please make sure you understand how it works and what it can do. For example, have a look at the example sheet in the Excel template file. Of course you are welcome to use any other Excel approach (pivot tables, `INDEX(.., MATCH())`, etc). However, the analysis must be done in the provided Excel template (one sheet per exercise).\n",
    ">\n",
    ">All plots require a legend (if there is more than one plot series) and axes labels. Points will be deducted if plots are not properly formatted.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Copied content from the lecture slides will not be counted as part of the answer. If you do feel the need to copy material from the slides, please ask for clarifications.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Only base discussions on the input data! Don't speculate on system properties which are not explicitly defined within the assignment. In this assignment we don't discuss the limitations of the model and to what extent it realistically represents a power system.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Many of the tasks ask for comparisons with previous tasks. These are mandatory. Points are deducted if the comparisons are missing.\n",

    "### BONUS EXERCISE: Does storage add value to wind power?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want to repeat the last exercise and assess the impact of large amounts of pumped hydro storage in the system. Using storage we can transfer energy from one time slot to another. This generally results in a \"smoothing\" of the electricity prices, i.e. high prices get lower, low prices get higher, price differences get smaller. This is because storage charging creates additional demand during certain seasons. This demand needs to be satisifed using more expensive generators. During the discharging seasons, the demand is lowered, causing electricity prices to drop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here we want to investigate the impact of this effect on the value of wind power.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, we assume that the storage has a limited power capacity (10'000 MW) but an unconstrained energy capacity. This might correspond to pumped hydro plants with a certain turbine size but whose lakes are large enough to satisfy all our storage needs.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We keep the old model and adjust some parameters and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the following variables and parameters which will define the storage asset (**note**: Since there is only one storage plant, we just use single value parameters, i.e. we don't define sets for storage):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Parameters**:\n",
    "     - Storage round trip efficiency (fraction of the charged energy which is available after discharging): `m.storage_eff = po.Param(initialize=0.75)`\n",
    "     - Storage power capacity: `m.storage_cap = po.Param(initialize=10000, mutable=True)`\n",
    "   * **Variables**: Here we can use the storage power capacity as an upper bound to the charging and discharging power, instead of defining an extra constraint. Like this we can deactivate the storage by setting the capacity parameter zero (`m.storage_cap = 0`):\n",
    "     - Storage charging/pumping during each season: `m.charging = po.Var(m.seasons, bounds=(0, m.storage_cap))`\n",
    "     - Storage discharging/turbining during each season: `m.discharging = po.Var(m.seasons, bounds=(0, m.storage_cap))`\n",
    "     - Stored energy during each season: `m.stored_energy = po.Var(m.seasons, bounds=(0, None))`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modify the constraints of the original model to include the additional storage operation. **Note**: If you add terms to the demand constraint equation, make sure that\n",
    "   the `m.demand[season]` is the only term on the right-hand side. Otherwise the electricity prices will be negative.\n",
    "4. Add the single additional constraint which is necessary to describe the storage operation. Have a look at the lecture slides. Tip: to access the \"previous season\" you can use a dictionary like this:\n",
